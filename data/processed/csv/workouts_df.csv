You will have slower times to start with, but they will begin to drop as good form becomes second nature. Main Set: 8x100 ALL OUT SPRINT! I want the recovery between these sets to be 2-3 minutes. I want your HR to come all the way back down, and the lactic acid to build up in your arms and legs. These need to be ALL OUT! As fast as humanly possible. That's the only reason you get such a long rest is because you need to be spent by the end of each 100. Also, these cannot get slower. I would prefer if they got faster. Record your times! 50s on one minute 15 seconds. I want you to do 10x50 sprints LEAVING on 1:15, so watch the clock! These are not necessarily all out, but still a sprint. 10x25 on 30 seconds. These ARE all out, and I want you leaving the wall at 30 seconds. Don't sandbag these because they're at the end of the workout.
