Cool Down: 5 minutes zone 1,"Use this workout to set or re confirm your zones. When setting your zones we share with the 80/20 calculator, so that is the calculator you will use inside of TrainingPeaks. The 80/20 calculator is based off of a 30 minute test, so doing a 30 minute test is going to be more accurate. If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones. A 20 minute test is still good to go off of, but if performing a 20 minute power test times your average 20 minute power by .95 to get your number to plug into the calculator. You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort. If going off of heart rate, take your highest 20 minute average heart rate and plug it into the 80/20 cycling heart rate calculator to set up your cycling heart rate zones.",127.0,1.01184940338135,31596.76953125,0.0,25.597453397110502,0.0,2108.24,25.597453397110502,568.2477316031806,0.0,0.0,0.0,312.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.167237532386785,0.0,33.167237532386785,,0.0,

I want your HR to come all the way back down, and the lactic acid to build up in your arms and legs. These need to be ALL OUT! As fast as humanly possible. That's the only reason you get such a long rest is because you need to be spent by the end of each 100. Also, these cannot get slower. I would prefer if they got faster. Record your times! 50s on one minute 15 seconds. I want you to do 10x50 sprints LEAVING on 1:15, so watch the clock! These are not necessarily all out, but still a sprint. 10x25 on 30 seconds. These ARE all out, and I want you leaving the wall at 30 seconds. Don't sandbag these because they're at the end of the workout.
