I want your HR to come all the way back down, and the lactic acid to build up in your arms and legs. These need to be ALL OUT! As fast as humanly possible. That's the only reason you get such a long rest is because you need to be spent by the end of each 100. Also, these cannot get slower. I would prefer if they got faster. Record your times! 50s on one minute 15 seconds. I want you to do 10x50 sprints LEAVING on 1:15, so watch the clock! These are not necessarily all out, but still a sprint. 10x25 on 30 seconds.

If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones.

You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort.

I want your HR to come all the way back down, and the lactic acid to build up in your arms and legs. These need to be ALL OUT! As fast as humanly possible. That's the only reason you get such a long rest is because you need to be spent by the end of each 100. Also, these cannot get slower. I would prefer if they got faster. Record your times! 50s on one minute 15 seconds. I want you to do 10x50 sprints LEAVING on 1:15, so watch the clock! These are not necessarily all out, but still a sprint. 10x25 on 30 seconds.

The 80/20 calculator is based off of a 30 minute test, so doing a 30 minute test is going to be more accurate. If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones. A 20 minute test is still good to go off of, but if performing a 20 minute power test times your average 20 minute power by .95 to get your number to plug into the calculator. You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort.

If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones. A 20 minute test is still good to go off of, but if performing a 20 minute power test times your average 20 minute power by .95 to get your number to plug into the calculator. You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort.

However, rest is a critical element of improving fitness. Adding activity to this rest day is a high risk decision. Very few athletes, of any ability level, can maintain a 16+ week training program without regular days off. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Congratulations on your decision on taking on the Advanced Olympic Training plan! Although not included in this training plan, 1-2 hours a week of strength training is strongly recommended, and Monday's are an excellent option.Finally, unlike the cycle and run workouts, the swim schedule has a great deal of flexibility and swim workouts can be moved or short swims even merged at the convenience of the athlete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones.

You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort.

If going off of watts plug in your average 30 minute power to calculate your bike power zones. A 20 minute test is still good to go off of, but if performing a 20 minute power test times your average 20 minute power by .95 to get your number to plug into the calculator. You can choose to go for 20 or 30 minutes. This is an all out effort.

Sprints!,Swim,"Warm up with: 200 swim 100 kick 200 pull Really focus on your form during the warm-up because you MUST keep good form on these sprints. You will have slower times to start with, but they will begin to drop as good form becomes second nature. Main Set: 8x100 ALL OUT SPRINT! I want the recovery between these sets to be 2-3 minutes. I want your HR to come all the way back down, and the lactic acid to build up in your arms and legs. These need to be ALL OUT! As fast as humanly possible. That's the only reason you get such a long rest is because you need to be spent by the end of each 100. Also, these cannot get slower. I would prefer if they got faster. Record your times! 50s on one minute 15 seconds. I want you to do 10x50 sprints LEAVING on 1:15, so watch the clock! These are not necessarily all out, but still a sprint. 10x25 on 30 seconds.
